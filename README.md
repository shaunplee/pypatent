# pypatent

pypatent is a tiny Python package to easily search for and scrape US Patent and Trademark Office Patent Data.

[PyPI page](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypatent)

#### New in version 1.2

This version implements Selenium support for scraping.
Previous versions were using the `requests` library for all requests, however this has had problems with the USPTO site lately.
I notice some users have been able to use `requests` without issue, while others get 4xx errors.

PyPatent Version 1.2 implements an optional new WebConnection object to give the user the option to use Selenium WebDrivers in place of the `requests` library.
This WebConnection object is optional.
If used, it should be passed as an argument when initializing `Search` or `Patent` objects.

Use it in the following cases:
* When you want to use Selenium instead of `requests`
* When you want to use `requests` but with a custom user-agent or headers

See bottom of README for examples.

## Requirements

Python 3, BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, re, selenium

## Installation

```
pip install pypatent
```

If using Selenium for scraping (introduced in version 1.2), be sure to install a Selenium WebDriver.
For Chrome, use `chromedriver`. For Firefox, use `geckodriver`.
See [the Selenium download page](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) for more details and options.

## Searching for patents

The Search object works similarly to the [Advanced Search at the USPTO](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm), with additional options.

### Specifying patent criteria for your search

There are two methods to specify your search criteria, and you can use one or both.

#### Search Method 1: Using a custom string

You may search for a certain string in all fields of the patent:
```python
pypatent.Search('microsoft') # Will return results matching 'microsoft' in any field
```

You may also specify complex search criteria as demonstrated on the [USPTO site](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/help/helpadv.htm):
```python
pypatent.Search('TTL/(tennis AND (racquet OR racket))')
```

#### Search Method 2: Specify USPTO search fields (see Field Codes below)

Alternatively, you can specify one or more Field Code arguments to search within the specified fields. Multiple Field Code arguments will create a search with AND logic. OR logic can be used within a single argument. For more complex logic, use a custom string.
```python
pypatent.Search(pn='adobe', ttl='software') # Equivalent to search('PN/adobe AND TTL/software')
pypatent.Search(pn=('adobe or macromedia'), ttl='software') # Equivalent to search('PN/(adobe or macromedia) AND TTL/software')
```

#### Combining search methods 1 and 2

String criteria can be used in conjunction with Field Code arguments:
```python
pypatent.Search('acrobat', pn='adobe', ttl='software') # Equivalent to search('acrobat AND PN/adobe AND TTL/software')
```

The Field Code arguments have the same meaning as on the [USPTO site](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm).

### Additional search options

#### Limit the number of results

The `results_limit` argument lets you change how many patent results are retrieved. The default is 50, equivalent to one page of results.

```python
pypatent.Search('microsoft', results_limit=10) # Fetch 10 results only
```

#### Specify whether to fetch details for each patent

By default, pypatent retrieves the details of every patent by visiting each patent's URL from the search results.
This can take a long time since each page has to be scraped.
If you just need the patent titles and URLs from the search results, set `get_patent_details` to `False`:

```python
pypatent.Search('microsoft', get_patent_details=False) # Fetch patent numbers and titles only
```

### Formatting your search results

pypatent has convenience methods to format the Search object into either a Pandas DataFrame or list of dicts.

#### Format as Pandas DataFrame:
```python
pypatent.Search('microsoft').as_dataframe()
```

#### Format as list of dicts:
```python
pypatent.Search('microsoft', get_patent_details=False).as_list()
```

Sample result (without patent details):
```
[{
     'title': 'Electronic device',
      'url': 'http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=microsoft&OS=microsoft&RS=microsoft'
 },
 
 {'title': 'Portable electric device', ... }
```

## The Patent class
The `Search` class uses the `Patent` class to retrieve and store patent details for a given patent URL.
You can use it directly if you already know the patent URL (e.g. you ran a Search with `get_patent_details=False`)

```python
# Create a Patent object
this_patent = pypatent.Patent(title='Base station device, first location management device, terminal device, communication control method, and communication system',
                              url='http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=4&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=aaa&OS=aaa&RS=aaa')

# Fetch the details
this_patent.fetch_details()
```

### Changelog
#### New in version 1.2

This version implements Selenium support for scraping.
Previous versions were using the `requests` library for all requests, however the USPTO site has been causing problems for it.
I notice some users have been able to use `requests` without issue, while others get 4xx errors.

PyPatent Version 1.2 implements a new WebConnection object to give the user the option to use Selenium WebDrivers in place of the `requests` library.
This WebConnection object is optional.
If used, it should be passed as an argument when initializing `Search` or `Patent` objects.
Use it in the following cases:
* When you want to use Selenium instead of `requests`
* When you want to use `requests` but with a custom user-agent or headers

An example using the Firefox WebDriver:

```python
import pypatent
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()  # Requires geckodriver in your PATH

conn = pypatent.WebConnection(use_selenium=True, selenium_driver=driver)

res = pypatent.Search('microsoft', get_patent_details=True, web_connection=conn)

print(res)
```

An example using the `requests` library with a custom user agent:
```python
import pypatent

conn = pypatent.WebConnection(use_selenium=False, user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.77 Safari/537.36')

res = pypatent.Search('microsoft', get_patent_details=True, web_connection=conn)

print(res)
```

An example using the `requests` library with default user agent (WebConnection is not necessary here as we are using the defaults)
```python
import pypatent

res = pypatent.Search('microsoft', get_patent_details=True)

print(res)
```

#### New in version 1.1:

This version makes searching and storing patent data easier:
* Simplified to 2 objects: `Search` and `Patent`
* A `Search` object searches the USPTO site and can output the results as a DataFrame or list. It can scrape the details of each patent, or just get the patent title and URL. Most users will only need to use this object.
* A `Patent` object fetches and holds a single patent's info. Fetching the patent's details is now optional. This object should only be used when you already have the patent URL and aren't conducting a search.
